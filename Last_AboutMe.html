   <p>Hi! My name is Hamza and I am a Junior at Dublin High School...I like to think that I've had unique life experiences which have equipped me with unique skills and a different yet empathetic perspective of things. Many might say that I'm good with people as I can resolve conflict in a calm and composed manner, appreciate people for exceptional performance, and pick someone up when they're down and help them integrate better into the team. I can code in muyltiple languages such as HTML and Python as well as work well with excel. I like to play sports as it helps relieve stress and can be used as a bonding exercise. Despite my background and childhood aspirations, I"ve pivoted from a more coding focused silicon valley career to a more finance based wall street career, fully aware of the negative connotations associated with the instituions and the people who work there. I am also an adept and understanding communicator and presentor, a skill which has been honed through years of debate and I'm at present a varsity debater in multiple formats(divisions).</p>
